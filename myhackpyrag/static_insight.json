  "Market Potential and Business Viability": {
    "score": 3,
    "justification": "The project does not address a clear market need or gap. The potential target audience size and reach are limited by the simple text-based interface. The game loop is continuous, but there is no additional revenue stream or monetization strategy."

  "Creativity Level": {
    "score": 6,
    "justification": "The project implements a classic game of Minesweeper, which is a well-known and established genre. The use of object-oriented programming principles is also commendable, but the overall design and implementation could be more innovative."

  "10th Grade Project Exhibition": {
    "score": 8,
    "justification": "The project demonstrates a good understanding of basic coding concepts and techniques. The use of CG ALIB library shows an attempt to learn new technologies. However, the lack of documentation and code organization hinders its overall quality."

  "Senior Solutions Architect": {
    "score": 2,
    "justification": "The project's architecture is simple and lacks scalability. The game loop could be optimized for better performance on lower-end hardware. Additionally, there are no error handling mechanisms or robust input validation."

  "Sculptor": {
    "score": 5,
    "justification": "The project accurately captures fine details in hand shapes and models. The frequency of successful molding trials without breaking or deforming the model shows promise, but could be improved with more iterations. Time-to-market for new mold designs is not applicable."
