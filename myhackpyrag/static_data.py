Summary of Complete Codebase:
**Narrative Summary**

This code implements a classic game of Minesweeper in C++. The program displays an 8x8 grid, with some cells containing hidden mines. The player's objective is to reveal all non-mine cells without detonating any mine. The game uses a simple text-based interface, where the player can navigate the grid using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D keys) and make selections by clicking on cells.

The code uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to encapsulate the game's logic and data structures. It defines a `Grid` class that represents the 8x8 grid, with methods for initializing the grid, counting bomb locations, and displaying the current state of the grid. The game loop continuously updates the display and checks for user input until the game is over.

The code also implements some interesting aspects, such as using a `cursor_i` and `cursor_j` pair to keep track of the player's position on the grid. When the player clicks on a cell, the program checks if it contains a mine or not, and updates the grid accordingly. The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed or when the player detonates a mine.

Note that I did not include any AI-related components in the analysis, as none were present in the provided code. If you'd like to add an AI component to the Minesweeper game, it would require a significant overhaul of the existing codebase.
