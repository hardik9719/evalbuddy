      "description": "Evaluates the project's originality, innovation, and out-of-the-box thinking. This metric considers factors such as the uniqueness of the core idea or concept, novel approaches to solving existing problems, innovative combinations of technologies or methodologies, unconventional user interactions or interfaces, creative use of data or resources, originality in design (both visual and functional), unexpected or surprising features that add value, and reimagining traditional concepts or processes. This metric helps assess how well the project pushes boundaries and introduces fresh ideas. It encourages participants to think beyond conventional solutions and rewards those who take creative risks. The Creativity Level metric values projects that stand out from the crowd, either through entirely new concepts or through innovative twists on existing ideas. It also considers the creative aspects of both the technical implementation and the user-facing elements of the project.",
