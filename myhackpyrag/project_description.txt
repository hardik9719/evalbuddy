Project Description: CodeLensLLM
Overview
CodeLensLLM is an innovative Python-based tool designed to analyze and summarize Python codebases efficiently. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), it extracts function and class signatures, providing a concise representation of large codebases. This tool is particularly valuable for developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs) who need to analyze extensive Python projects while maximizing limited context windows.

Key Features
1. AST-based Signature Extraction: Utilizes Python's AST module to extract function and method signatures accurately.
2. Docstring Integration: Offers optional inclusion of docstrings for comprehensive code documentation.
3. Async Support: Recognizes and properly represents asynchronous functions and methods.
4. Type Annotation Preservation: Maintains type hints in function signatures for enhanced code understanding.
5. Hierarchical Output: Organizes output in a structured format (files → classes → methods) for easy navigation.
6. Configurable Reporting: Allows customization of empty item reporting and docstring inclusion.
7. JSON Output: Generates output in JSON format for easy integration with other tools and workflows.

Technical Highlights
- Python-Based: Leverages Python's built-in libraries for efficient and reliable code analysis.
- AST Parsing: Employs Abstract Syntax Tree parsing for accurate code structure analysis without execution.
- Modular Design: Structured with separate functions for file collection, signature extraction, and output generation.
- Error Handling: Incorporates robust error logging for syntax errors and other exceptions.
- Customizable Configuration: Offers global settings for fine-tuning tool behavior.

Use Cases
- Pre-processing codebases for LLM ingestion
- Rapid code structure analysis for large Python projects
- Automated documentation generation
- Code complexity assessment
- Identifying function and class hierarchies in unfamiliar codebases

Future Enhancements
While the current implementation provides powerful codebase analysis, future versions could incorporate:
- Integration with popular IDEs for real-time code analysis
- Support for additional programming languages
- Advanced code metrics and complexity analysis
- Visualization of code structure and dependencies
- API for seamless integration with other development tools

Conclusion
CodeLensLLM offers an efficient and powerful solution for Python codebase analysis, particularly tailored for use with Large Language Models. Its ability to provide concise, structured summaries of extensive codebases makes it an invaluable tool for developers working on large-scale Python projects or integrating code analysis with AI-driven development workflows. The tool's focus on efficiency and comprehensive signature extraction positions it as a key asset in modern software development practices, especially in contexts where understanding and summarizing large codebases quickly is crucial.
